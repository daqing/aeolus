URI.Munge
TYPE: string/null
VERSION: 1.3.0
DEFAULT: NULL
--DESCRIPTION--

<p>
    Munges all browsable (usually http, https and ftp)
    absolute URI's into another URI, usually a URI redirection service.
    This directive accepts a URI, formatted with a <code>%s</code> where 
    the url-encoded original URI should be inserted (sample: 
    <code>http://www.google.com/url?q=%s</code>).
</p>
<p>
    Uses for this directive:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Prevent PageRank leaks, while being fairly transparent 
        to users (you may also want to add some client side JavaScript to 
        override the text in the statusbar). <strong>Notice</strong>:
        Many security experts believe that this form of protection does
not deter spam-bots. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Redirect users to a splash page telling them they are leaving your
        website. While this is poor usability practice, it is often
mandated
        in corporate environments.
    </li>
</ul>
